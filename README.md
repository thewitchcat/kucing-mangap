# Hi there, I'm Arpachshadz

I'm a **Full-Stack Web Developer** with 3+ years of experience, passionate about building scalable and user-friendly applications. I love diving deep into **system design**, **software architecture**, and finding the most elegant ways to build robust applications.

## 💡 About Me

- 💻 Working with: `Node.js`, `TypeScript`, `Vue.js`, `Python`, `Django`, `Django Ninja`
- 🔗 Familiar with building: `REST APIs`, `SQL Databases (MySQL & PostgreSQL)`
- 🔭 Currently exploring: `NestJS`, `Angular`, `.NET (ASP.NET Core - C#)`, `Podman`, `Docker`
- 🧠 Curious about: Desktop & Mobile development (for the future 👀)
- 🛠️ Personal project: Building a full-stack app using `NestJS` & `Angular` *(in progress...)*
- 📖 I like reading **anything** – from blogs and articles to framework documentation (yes, really 🤓)

## 💼 Real-World Experience

I've had the opportunity to work on full-fledged apps in different industries:

- 🏥 **Healthcare** – Hospital Management System
- ⚖️ **Legal** – Notary Public Digital Workflow
- 🛒 **Retail** – Minimarket POS & Inventory System

In these projects, I worked primarily on the frontend using Vue.js in two of them, and took on a full-stack role in the other — giving me well-rounded insight into how both ends of a modern web application come together.

## 🚧 Side Project

🔧 I'm currently building a full-stack application using **NestJS** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend. It's still in development, but it's where I apply system design ideas and experiment with architectural patterns.

*(Stay tuned – I'll share more once it's ready!)*

## Fun Fact

I genuinely enjoy reading... even documentation!  
There's something calming about exploring the depths of a framework’s design decisions.
